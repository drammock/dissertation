\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First and foremost I thank my advisor, mentor, and dissertation chair, Richard Wright.  For the last three years he has (among other things) challenged, inspired, critiqued, funded, encouraged, frustrated, and befriended me.  One of the main reasons I finished graduate school was that I truly enjoyed going to our meetings.  I also owe a large debt to the other members of my dissertation committee: Erick Gallun, Sharon Hargus, and Gina-Anne Levow, who guided me with keen questions along the way, and struggled through my inelegant draft prose to help me refine this work.  I would be remiss if I failed to mention Pam Souza, who has been a great collaborator, and who showed me by her own example that science is at its best when we practice it in the service of humanity.

My colleagues in the UW Linguistics Department have been fine companions, and I have profited from many stimulating discussions over the years.  Special thanks go to Bill McNeill, Julia Miller, Michael Goodman, Valerie Freeman, Sarala Puthuval, Josh Crowgey, and most especially Darren Tanner and Steve Moran.  I must also acknowledge my dear friends, who for several years have tolerated my absence from parties, concerts, openings, and festivals, and yet still hugged and smiled when I did manage to show up once in a while.  My parents have been especially tolerant in this regard, and deserve thanks for so much more than I can describe here.

Along my winding path through education, I have had a number of gifted teachers who quietly inspired me to remain curious and to someday be as good a teacher as they were.  I have always wanted to acknowledge them publicly; this seems as good a place as any.  Thanks to (in chronological order): Sherry Brown (chemistry, grade 10), David Adams (calculus), Dennis Lamb (Greek and Roman literature), Bill Moody (cellular neurobiology), Larry BonJour (epistemology), Bill Talbott (ethics and social philosophy), David Knechteges (Chinese literature), Bi Nyan-Ping (Chinese language), Zev Handel (Chinese historical linguistics), and Chris Stecker (psychoacoustics).
