\chapter{Introduction}
This thesis is concerned with two main questions.  The first question — \emph{what is the relationship between prosody and intelligibility?} — is investigated using careful resynthesis of read sentences, which are then presented in a listening task.  By \term{prosody} I mean the patterns of pitch, duration and loudness that combine to form patterns of prominence and comprise the rhythms of speech.  The second question — \emph{what is the relationship between prosody and the familiar talker advantage?} — is investigated in a training task utilizing the same stimuli created to address the first question.  

\section[Overview]{Overview of the thesis \label{sec:Overview}}
The first part of the thesis comprises a review of relevant literature (Chapter~\ref{chap:Background}), followed by a formal statement of research questions (Chapter~\ref{chap:Questions}).  A detailed description of methods (including stimulus creation, experimental design, and data analysis) follows in Chapter~\ref{chap:Methods}.  Results of the two experiments are presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:Results}, followed by a general discussion in Chapter~\ref{chap:Discussion}.

	\ac{crm} & Coordinate response measure (a corpus of parallel sentences of the form “Ready ⟨\textsc{callsign}⟩ go to ⟨\textsc{color}⟩ ⟨\textsc{digit}⟩ now”).  In a typical competing speech usage, the listener is told to attend to the speech stream containing a particular callsign, and to repeat the color and digit from that stream.  See \citet{BoliaEtAl2000} for details.\\
\midrule
	{dB} & Decibels (a dimensionless base\=/10 logarithmic unit commonly used to express the intensity or power of a sound, relative to a known reference value).\\
\midrule
	{dB \ac{hl}} & Intensity in decibels relative to frequency\-/specific threshold averages representative of normal\-/hearing humans \citepalias{ansi2004}.  “\ac{hl}” stands for “hearing level”.\\
\midrule
	{dB \ac{spl}} & Intensity in decibels relative to 20 micropascals (μPa) \citepalias{ansi1994}.  “\ac{spl}” stands for “sound pressure level”.\\
\midrule
	\ac{dtw} & Dynamic Time Warping (a method of non\-/linear time\-/scaling of a sequence that relies on inserting or removing elements to align key landmarks in the sequences being equated).  See \citet{KruskalLiberman1983}.\\
\midrule
	\fo & Fundamental frequency (of speech).  Often represented as F₀ or F0, the form \fo{} is preferred because it emphasizes that the fundamental frequency is not a formant (which are typically represented as F1, F2, \etc).  The form f0 is an acceptable substitute when glyph choice is restricted to \ac{ascii} characters.\\
\midrule
	F2×F1 & The acoustic space defined by the center frequencies of the first and second formants of sonorant speech sounds (usually vowels).\\
\midrule
	\ac{hl} & See {dB \ac{hl}}.\\
\midrule
	L1, L2, \etc. & First (native) language, second language, \etc.\\
\midrule
	\ac{ltas} & Long\-/term average spectrum (a representation of the mean sound power present across various frequencies in a signal).\\
\midrule
	\ac{mcmc} & Markov\-/chain Monte Carlo (an algorithm for sampling from probability distributions; useful for simulating the parameters of mixed models for, \eg, obtaining estimated \textit{p}\=/values).\\
%\midrule
	\psola & Pitch synchronous overlap and add (a method for time- or frequency\-/domain resynthesis of speech; see \citealt{CharpentierMoulines1988, MoulinesCharpentier1990}).  \psola{} is a trademark of France Télécom.\\
\midrule
	\ac{rms} & Root mean square, a measure of sound magnitude, defined as:\newline\newline \(\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}(x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2)}\)\newline\newline where \(x_1 \ldots x_n\) are the samples of a digital signal.\\
\midrule
	\ac{rmse} & Root mean squared error, a measure of the difference between two signals or time series, defined as:\newline\newline \(\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}((x_1-y_1)^2+(x_2-y_2)^2+\cdots+(x_n-y_n)^2)}\)\newline\newline where \(x_1 \ldots x_n\) and \(y_1 \ldots y_n\) are values of two time series at time points \(n\).\\
\midrule
	\ac{snr} & Signal\-/to\-/noise ratio, usually expressed in decibels: \( \textnormal{\ac{snr}}_{\textnormal{dB}} = 20\log_{10}\frac{A_{\textnormal{signal}}}{A_{\textnormal{noise}}} \) (where \(A_{\textnormal{signal}}\) and \(A_{\textnormal{noise}}\) are \ac{rms} amplitudes).\\
\midrule
	\ac{spl} & See {dB \ac{spl}}.\\
\midrule
	\ac{srt} & Speech reception threshold (the intensity level or \ac{snr} at which a listener achieves 50\% correct in a speech recognition task).\\
