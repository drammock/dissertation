\section{The corpus}
Stimuli for the experiments described here were a subset of the IEEE “Harvard” sentences \citep{HarvardSents} drawn from the PNW/NC corpus, as described in \citet{McCloyEtAl2013}.  Based on that study, three talkers were chosen for the present experiments: PNM02, PNM05, and PNM07.  These talkers were selected because the Pacific Northwest male talkers exhibited the largest spread in inherent intelligibility in the corpus, and those three talkers formed the natural endpoints and midpoint of that group (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:dotchart}).

\section{stimulus design\label{sec:StimDesign}}
Why PSOLA?  Brief comparison of different methods for manipulating duration.  Malah1979 ("linearly combining adjacent intervals of speech to avoid major discontinuities in the waveform"), MoulinesCharpentier1990 (PSOLA).  Relate to the studies that used them: PichenyEtAl1989 (Malah method), UchanskiEtAl1996 (segment-by-segment time scaling), LiuZeng2006 (adding silences, "uniform scaling" = PSOLA?).  Cf KrauseBraida2002, KrauseBraida2004.

\section{experiment sessions}
Stimuli were presented with a stationary gaussian masker noise, frequency shaped to match the long term spectral average of the corpus of stimuli, at a +2 dB \ac{snr}.  To ensure target audibility, the level of the speech was held constant at 68 dB SPL (dB \ac{rms} in a 6 cc coupler) and the masker noise was digitally added to the speech to achieve the desired \ac{snr}.  The combined signal was presented in a sound-insulated booth over closed-back supra-aural headphones (Sennheiser HD 25–1 II).  Listeners were instructed to repeat each sentence they heard, to give partial answers when they only heard some words, and to guess when they were unsure.  Trials were scored 0–5 on keywords correct during the task.  An audio recording was made of listener responses, and scoring uncertainties were resolved offline by a second researcher.  Talker-sentence-\ac{snr} assignments were random and unique for each listener, with the following constraints: (a) each listener heard each talker an equal number of times; (b) within each talker, each listener heard each \ac{snr} an equal number of times; (c) each listener heard each sentence only once.
