\section{The corpus}
Stimuli for the experiments described here were a subset of the \ac{ieee} “Harvard” sentences \citep{HarvardSents} drawn from the \ac{pn/nc} corpus \citep{xxx}.  The sentences in the \ac{pn/nc} corpus were selected based on absence of alliteration or rhyming, avoidance of focus/contrast readings, and lack of marked locutions; The full list of sentences used is given in Appendix~\ref{apx:HarvardSents}.  

Based on within-dialect intelligibility scores from \citet{McCloyEtAl2013}, three talkers were chosen for the present experiments: PNM02, PNM05, and PNM07.  These talkers were selected because, as a group, the Pacific Northwest male talkers exhibited the largest spread in inherent intelligibility in the corpus, and those three talkers formed the endpoints and midpoint of that group (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:dotchart}).

\section{Stimulus design\label{sec:StimDesign}}
Why \ac{psola}?  Brief comparison of different methods for manipulating duration.  Malah1979 ("linearly combining adjacent intervals of speech to avoid major discontinuities in the waveform"), MoulinesCharpentier1990 (\ac{psola}).  Relate to the studies that used them: PichenyEtAl1989 (Malah method), UchanskiEtAl1996 (segment-by-segment time scaling), LiuZeng2006 (adding silences, "uniform scaling" = \ac{psola}?).

\section{experiment sessions}
% Rationale for how much training to do:  
% \citep{YonanSommers2000}: Trained talkerID on 4 talkers (2M2F) over 2 days.  Each day: 60 exposure trials, 40 trials training w/ feedback, 60 more exp, 40 more training, 80 test.  All phases were half high-context and half low-context sentences.  End of day 2: single words \& sentences in SNR -5,0,+5, half high- half low-context, half familiar talkers half novel, half male talkers half female.  Familiar/unfamiliar talkers were piloted to make sure they were equally intelligible generally, and to old vs young people.  RESULTS: young listeners near ceiling on talkerID both day1 and day2; old listeners 73\% and 76\%.  Training on sentence material did not aid on the single word task (same as NygaardPisoni1998).  There was a benefit of familiar talker for sentence materials, which was stronger at lower SNRs.  A similar pattern obtained for a second experiment with talker exposure instead of talkerID training.
% \citep{VanEngen2012}: Two 30-minute training sessions (64 sentences) with noise (either SSN, English 2-babble, Mandarin 2-babble) and feedback.  Posttest 1 familiar, 1 unfamiliar talker, half in English babble, half in mandarin.  Trained and tested at their HINT threshold -3dB (based on VanEngen2010) to avoid floor/ceiling.  Results: “(1) listeners were able to take advantage of target talker familiarity; (2) training with babble was more effective than SSN training; and (3) after babble training, listeners improved most in coping with the babble in which they were trained [English or Mandarin]. In general, the results show that processes related both to tuning in to speech targets and tuning out speech maskers can be improved with auditory training”

Stimuli were presented with a stationary gaussian masker noise, frequency shaped to match the long term spectral average of the corpus of stimuli, at a +2 dB \ac{snr}.  To ensure target audibility, the level of the speech was held constant at 68 dB SPL (dB \ac{rms} in a 6 cc coupler) and the masker noise was digitally added to the speech to achieve the desired \ac{snr}.  The combined signal was presented in a sound-insulated booth over closed-back supra-aural headphones (Sennheiser HD 25–1 II).  Listeners were instructed to repeat each sentence they heard, to give partial answers when they only heard some words, and to guess when they were unsure.  Trials were scored 0–5 on keywords correct during the task.  An audio recording was made of listener responses, and scoring uncertainties were resolved offline by a second researcher.  Talker-sentence-\ac{snr} assignments were random and unique for each listener, with the following constraints: (a) each listener heard each talker an equal number of times; (b) within each talker, each listener heard each \ac{snr} an equal number of times; (c) each listener heard each sentence only once.
