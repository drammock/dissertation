\chapter{Background}
This chapter presents a brief overview of relevant literature on speech intelligibility, prosody, and talker familiarity.  Because the experiments described in this thesis involve speech obscured by background noise, particular attention is given to studies of auditory masking.  The discussion of talker familiarity touches on both short-term familiarity (i.e., training and exposure studies) and long-term familiarity.  Finally, the discussion of prosody focuses on pitch, loudness, and duration as they relate to speech perception.

\section{Masking}
It is well-known that auditory masking is dependent on both the spectrotemporal characteristics of the masking sound as well as its relationship to the target sound.  \citet{Miller1947} puts it succinctly: “...the masking of speech [depends] on three characteristics of the masking sound: (1) its intensity relative to the intensity of the speech, (2) its acoustic spectrum, and (3) its temporal continuity” \citep[106]{Miller1947}.  Even the early experiments of \citeauthor{WegelLane1924} (which involve only pure-tone targets and maskers) reveal the importance of the \emph{relationship} between target and masker sounds, in their observation that masker tones close in frequency to the target tone are the best maskers, except when the frequencies are so similar as to cause beating \citep{WegelLane1924}.  
%Quantitative measurements of auditory masking began in the 1920s with the seminal experiments of \citet{WegelLane1924}, who described the masking of one pure-tone signal by a second pure-tone signal of different frequency.  Studies of speech masking soon followed, with the work of \citet{Miller1947}, \citet{Cherry1953}, Tolhurst \citep{BlackEtAl1953}, Hirsh \citep{HirshEtAl1954}, Stevens \citep{HawkinsStevens1950}, and others.  %TODO: say what they did
Since those early experiments, numerous aspects of the target-masker relationship have been investigated and found to impact the masking of speech.  In this section, those factors are discussed in four broad categories: those related to masker signal type, those related to the talker, those related to the listener, and those related to the target signal content.

\subsection{Energetic and informational masking}
Early masking experiments \citep[e.g.,][]{HawkinsStevens1950,Tolhurst1957b,PollackPickett1958} were often performed with noise maskers: random (gaussian) signals, usually without any amplitude modulation (“stationary maskers”) or frequency shaping (“white noise maskers”).  Masking due to any such random signal is typically termed “energetic masking”, reflecting the idea that the masking is a consequence of elevated signal detection thresholds in the auditory filters of the cochlea \citep{DurlachEtAl2003,xxx}.  However, most everyday situations involve listening to speech in the presence of competing speech streams — a situation poorly modeled by stationary white noise maskers, since real speech is both amplitude modulated and frequency shaped (indeed, the frequency shaping is itself dynamic).  

When speech is used as a masker, the amplitude modulations in the masker speech create temporal variations in \snr\ of the signal that can offer “glimpses” of the target stream \citep{FestenPlomp1990}.  The existence of such glimpses make speech a (potentially) worse masker than stationary noise, since listeners can use them to reconstruct neighboring spans of the target stream that are less clearly heard (based on lexical knowledge, phonotactics, contextual probabilities, etc., \citep{xxx}).  However, glimpses can also occur with amplitude-modulated random noise maskers, and if noise maskers are both amplitude-modulated and frequency-shaped so as to be maximally comparable to speech maskers, what we find is that target perception accuracy is lower when masked by speech than by noise \citep[e.g.,][]{CarhartEtAl1969,LewisEtAl1988,SimpsonCooke2005}.  The “additional” masking present in speech maskers is termed “informational masking” (less commonly: “perceptual masking”), and is usually attributed to the information contained in the masker signal causing competition for language processing resources at higher levels of the auditory and language processing streams in the brain \citep{DurlachEtAl2003,xxx}.

%\subsection{Multitalker masking}
One can simultaneously reduce glimpses and decrease the recognizability of background speech by increasing the total number of background speech streams (these are often called “(multitalker) babble maskers”).  Early work by \citet{Miller1947} using babble maskers found that the degree of masking increased as the number of competing speech signals increased.  However, more recent research suggests that indefinitely increasing the number of talkers does not necessarily increase masking: total masking seems to plateau around 6–8 background talkers and gradually recede back to the lower level of masking seen in stationary, frequency-shaped random noise maskers as the number of background talkers is increased further \citep{BrungartEtAl2001,SimpsonCooke2005}.  This finding can be understood as the interaction between energetic and informational masking: %I interpret this finding as being consistent with the view that there are two competing aspects of a babble masker signal.  %: its patterns of spectrotemporal variation, and the information encoded by them.  More concretely, the amplitude modulation and spectral dynamics of natural speech allow occasional glimpsing of the target signal, effectively lowering masking in cases where the listener can recover whole words or phrases based on only partial suprathreshold access to the target signal \citep{Cooke2006}.  In contrast, the informational content of the background speech has the potential to be recognized by the listener and thereby introduce activations in the auditory and language processing systems of the brain that conflict with the target signal, and thus interfere with auditory word formation and/or lexical access.\citep{xxx}  
as the number of background talkers increases, the spectrotemporal glimpses tend to decrease (increasing energetic masking), while the informational content of any individual masker voice becomes increasingly obscured by competing background talkers (decreasing informational masking).  The “peak” masking seen with 6–8 talkers is thus a consequence of the interaction of these two aspects of the masker signals.  As \citeauthor{SimpsonCooke2005} point out, as the number of talkers continues to increase, spectrotemporal variation decreases and the babble masker more and more closely approximates the long-term average spectrum of speech.

\subsection{Target-masker similarity}
Another important factor in the perception of speech in noise is the similarity of the masker and target signals.  The perceived spatial origin of the competing speech streams can be construed as a form of target-masker (dis)similarity, and numerous studies have shown a release from masking due to spatial separation between the target and masker streams \citep[e.g.,][]{BrungartSimpson2002, FreymanEtAl1999, FreymanEtAl2004, KiddEtAl2005a, JohnstoneLitovsky2006}.  \citet{Brungart2001} showed that similarity between the voices in the target and masker speech streams was also predictive of masking.  In particular, \citeauthor{Brungart2001} showed that perception of the target stream is most difficult when the voices in the target and masker streams belong to the same person, moderately difficult when the voices belong to same-gendered talkers, and least difficult when the target and masker voices belong to a gender-mismatched pair (a finding later replicated by \citealt{HelferFreyman2008}).  

Similarity in the language of the target and masker streams also affects masking.  For example, native English listeners perform better on English target speech when the masker speech is Spanish \citep{GarciaLecumberriCooke2006}, Dutch \citep{BrouwerEtAl2012}, or Modern Standard Chinese \citep{VanEngenBradlow2007} rather than English; experiments by \citet{RhebergenEtAl2005} showed similar effects for Dutch listeners exposed to Dutch target speech with either Dutch or Swedish masker speech.  Relatedly, informational masking is affected the accessibility or perceptibility of the information in the masker stream(s): \citet{CalandruccioEtAl2010} showed that for English target speech and native English-speaking listeners, native English masks better than foreign-accented English (corollary experiments confirmed that the difference was due to variation in the intelligibility of the background talker, not spectrotemporal differences between their speech).  Perhaps most interestingly, \citet{BrouwerEtAl2012} showed that semantically anomalous English sentences provide less masking than semantically coherent ones, but no similar effect was found for English targets masked by semantically well-formed and anomalous Dutch speech.  % TODO: add in the L1 L2 study here (VanEngen2010)

Such findings may be explained by appeal to “lexical pop-out” of specific words in the masker speech \citep{HoenEtAl2007,BoulengerEtAl2010}.  According to such an explanation, background speech in a language the listener understands can interfere with target speech stream perception relatively late in the auditory processing stream, such as the point at which lexemes are recognized or accessed.  In contrast (so the explanation goes), foreign-language babble is unlikely to trigger lexical competition except by dint of superficial similarity of foreign and native words (a relatively low probability occurrence).  This reasoning can be extended to \citeauthor[’s]{CalandruccioEtAl2010} finding about the ability of high-intelligibility (native) speech to mask better than low-intelligibility (foreign-accented) speech, on the assumption that words are high-intelligibility precisely because they more readily trigger lexical activation (due to, e.g., greater cue redunancy).  Similarly, the weaker masking seen with babble comprising semantically anomalous sentences could be explained by a lack of semantic priming in the masker sentences, though the extension of the lexical popout explanation to this phenomenon is somewhat more tenuous.  Moreover, the phenomenon of lexical popout presumably becomes less likely as the number of competing speech streams increases, so if differences between maskers of differing language, intelligibility, or semantic content are found with high numbers of background talkers, some other explanation must be proposed.

\subsection{Stimulus uncertainty}
Another apparent source of informational masking is the trial-to-trial regularity of the target and masker stimuli.  In other words, perception of target speech is generally better when target talkers are presented blockwise \citep{xxx}, or when the same masker is used on each trial \citep{xxx}.

	\item{It has been shown that foreign babble masks less well than native babble \citep{RhebergenEtAl2005,VanEngenBradlow2007,WuEtAl2011}.  At least in some cases, native-language babble masking is due to due to distracting lexical pop-out \citep{HoenEtAl2007}.  However, it is unclear whether differences are solely attributable to lexical interference from the native background speech, or whether other aspects of the native and foreign speech might be contributing to differential masking ability (e.g., familiar vs unfamiliar phones, rhythms, or intonation contours). Rhebergen et al's study is particularly problematic, since their native-language masker (Dutch) was time-scaled using PSOLA to match the speech rate of the (unmodified) foreign-language masker (Swedish).}

	\item{neighborhood density}

For example, \citet{LewisEtAl1988} showed that words that are predictable from context are harder to mask, in that they are recoverable (or at least guessable) at lower SNRs than the same words in low-context sentences.  At the same time, words that are predictable from context are typically articulated less distinctively, as though the talker were balancing their own articulatory effort with expectations that the listener is paying attention and can recover some words more easily than others \citep{Wright2004}.  }
	\item{Lexical activation (\textsc{aka}, word recognition) also helps when learning to recognize talkers: if the talkers are speaking an unfamiliar language, it is harder to learn to distinguish their voices \citep{PerrachioneWong2007}.}

	\item{priming target talker voice and spatial location (=familiarity) \citep{KiddEtAl2005a, KitterickEtAl2010}}
\end{itm}


%A synthesis of this research leads to the conclusion that virtually every aspect of a target or masker stimulus is potentially relevant to speech perception, including many facets of speech that are often difficult to balance or control for (e.g., talker voice quality, timing of glimpses in the masker envelope, lexical frequency and semantic predictability of target words, familiarity with the talker’s voice or dialect, etc).
