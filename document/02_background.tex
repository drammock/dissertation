\chapter{Background}
This chapter presents a brief overview of relevant literature on speech intelligibility, prosody, and talker familiarity.  Because the experiments described in this thesis involved speech obscured by background noise, particular attention is given to the perception of speech-in-noise.  The discussion of talker familiarity touches on both short-term familiarity (i.e., training studies) and long-term familiarity.  Finally, the discussion of prosody addresses pitch, loudness, and duration as they relate to speech perception.

\section{The intelligibility of speech in noise}
Quantitative measurements of auditory masking began in the 1920s with the seminal experiments of \citet{WegelLane1924}, who described the masking of one pure-tone signal by a second pure-tone signal of different frequency.  Studies of speech masking followed with the work of \citet{Miller1947}, \citet{Cherry1953}, Tolhurst \citep{BlackEtAl1953}, Hirsh \citep{HirshEtAl1954}, Stevens \citep{HawkinsStevens1950}, and others.  %TODO: say what they did
Since then, numerous factors have been found to impact the intelligibility of speech in noise.  In this section, those factors are discussed in four broad categories: those related to masker signal type, those related to the talker, those related to the listener, and those related to the target signal content.

\subsection{Noise maskers and speech maskers: energetic and informational masking}
Early masking experiments \citep[e.g.,][]{HawkinsStevens1950,Tolhurst1957,PollackPickett1958} were often performed with noise maskers: random (gaussian) signals, usually without any amplitude modulation (“stationary maskers”) or frequency shaping (“white noise maskers”).  Masking due to any such random signal is typically termed “energetic masking”, reflecting the idea that the masking is a consequence of elevated signal detection thresholds in the auditory filters of the cochlea \citep{DurlachEtAl2003}.  However, most everyday situations involve listening to speech in the presence of competing speech streams — a situation poorly modeled by stationary white noise maskers, since real speech is both amplitude modulated and frequency shaped (indeed, the frequency shaping is itself dynamic).  

When speech is used as a masker, the amplitude modulations in background speech create temporal variations in \snr\ of the signal that can offer “glimpses” of the target stream.  The existence of such glimpses make speech a (potentially) worse masker than stationary noise, since listeners can use such glimpses to reconstruct neighboring spans of the target stream that were less clearly heard (based on lexical knowledge, phonotactics, contextual probabilities, etc., \citealt{XXX}).  Thus it is surprising that background speech is in fact a better masker than background noise, provided a fair comparison is made by amplitude-modulating and frequency-shaping the noise to resemble speech spectrotemporally.  In such experiments, we see a clear and consistent masking difference between speech maskers and noise maskers, where target perception accuracy is lower when masked by competing speech \citep{CarhartEtAl1969,LewisEtAl1988,SimpsonCooke2005}.  The “additional” masking present in speech maskers is termed “informational masking” (less commonly: “perceptual masking”), and is most commonly attributed to competition for language processing resources at higher levels of the auditory and language processing streams in the brain \citep{DurlachEtAl2003,XXX}.

However, one can simultaneously reduce glimpses and decrease the recognizability of background speech by increasing the total number of background speech streams (these are often called “babble maskers”).  Early work by \citet{Miller1947} using babble maskers found that the degree of masking increased as the number of competing speech signals increased.  However, more recent research suggests that indefinitely increasing the number of talkers does not necessarily increase masking: total masking seems to plateau around 6–8 background talkers and gradually recede back to the lower level of masking seen in stationary, frequency-shaped random noise maskers as the number of background talkers is increased further \citep{BrungartEtAl2001,SimpsonCooke2005}.

This finding is consistent with the view that there are two competing aspects of a babble masker signal: its patterns of spectrotemporal variation, and the information encoded by them.  In particular, the amplitude modulation and spectral dynamics of natural speech allow occasional glimpsing of the target signal, effectively lowering masking in cases where the listener can recover whole words or phrases based on only partial suprathreshold access to the target signal \citep{Cooke2006}.  In contrast, the informational content of the background speech has the potential to be recognized by the listener and thereby introduce activations in the auditory and language processing systems of the brain that conflict with the target signal, and thus interfere with auditory word formation and/or lexical access.\citep{XXX}  As the number of background talkers increases, the spectrotemporal glimpses tend to decrease (increasing masking), while the informational content of any individual masker voice becomes increasingly obscured by competing background talkers (decreasing masking).  The “peak” masking seen with 6–8 talkers is thus a consequence of the interaction of these two processes. 

Other factors that modulate informational masking have been widely investigated.  Some factors known to decrease informational masking include language mismatch between the target and masker speech,\citep{RhebergenEtAl2005, VanEngenBradlow2007, WuEtAl2011, BrouwerEtAl2012} perceived spatial separation of the target and masker voices,\citep{BrungartSimpson2002, FreymanEtAl1999, FreymanEtAl2004, KiddEtAl2005b, JohnstoneLitovsky2006} and dissimilarity between the target and masker voices.\citep{Brungart2001}  These and other factors will be discussed in following sections.

%A synthesis of this research leads to the conclusion that virtually every aspect of a target or masker stimulus is potentially relevant to speech perception, including many facets of speech that are often difficult to balance or control for (e.g., talker voice quality, timing of glimpses in the masker envelope, lexical frequency and semantic predictability of target words, familiarity with the talker’s voice or dialect, etc).
