	\item{decomposing effects of prosodic dimensions}
	\begin{itm}
		\item{{\bfseries Experiment 5:} What are the relative contributions of duration, pitch, and intensity to talker intelligibility?  (Repeat of experiment 1 where only 1 or 2 of the dimensions are replaced via resynthesis.)}
	\end{itm}
	\item{talker ID studies}
	\begin{itm}
		\item{{\bfseries Experiment 6:} Can you train listeners to make a reliable talker ID distinction on the basis of prosody alone?  Can listeners reliably categorize B/C and B/A as different talkers?}
		\item{{\bfseries Experiment 7:} Can you train listeners to make a reliable talker ID distinction when prosody has been neutralized?  Can listeners reliably categorize C/B and A/B as different talkers?}
