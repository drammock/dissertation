my dissertation. Abstract:

> This thesis concerns the relationship between speech intelligibility and
  speech prosody, and the role that speech prosody plays in the perceptual
  advantage that occurs when listening to a familiar talker.  A parallel corpus
  of 90 sentences (each spoken by three talkers of varying intelligibility) was
  used to create resynthesized stimuli in which fundamental frequency (ƒ₀),
  intensity, and patterns of syllable duration were swapped between all
  possible pairs of talkers.  An additional 90 sentences were reserved for use
  as training stimuli.

> Findings from speech-in-noise tasks suggest that the contribution of prosody
  to intelligibility varies considerably across talkers, evidenced by
  differences in sentence intelligibility after prosodic replacement from
  different prosodic donors. In particular, high-intelligibility talkers need
  not have particularly “good” or “helpful” prosody if their intelligibility
  rests on articulatory strategies that emphasize robust segmental cues, while
  talkers with relatively good prosody may nonetheless have low intelligibility
  (due to non-prosodic factors).

> Post hoc acoustic analyses of the stimuli (interpreted in light of the
  behavioral results) suggest that many acoustic measures index both prosodic
  and non-prosodic aspects of the speech signal, whereas acoustic measures that
  reflect only the prosodic component of intelligibility are harder to find.
  Mean ƒ₀ range and mean ƒ₀ dynamicity appear to be the most promising measures
  in this regard, but utterance-final creaky voicing presents a challenge to
  interpretation due to its exaggeration of ƒ₀-related measures.

> Results of the familiarization experiments were inconclusive; listeners
  trained on different talkers showed different degrees of task adaptation
  during familiarization/training, but were unable to generalize to a testing
  phase involving multiple talkers presented in random order.  Thus the
  contribution of prosody to the familiar talker advantage remains unclear.
